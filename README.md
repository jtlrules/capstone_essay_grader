# Grading Essays With Machine Learning by Josh Little

Different files in the repo are simply different versions of the program.

The final iteration is grader.py.

To run the grader in its current state, you will need to download the GloVe word embeddings prior to running.
The files are massive and therefore cannot be hosted on GitHub. The files can be found here: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

First run preprocessing.py to clean the data and put it into a csv file. The csv file it outputs is "data.csv".

You can then run grader.py to run the neural network.
